title: Conscious Consumption

All consumption produces no value. Whether man is staring at a beautiful painting or a terrible movie is irrelevant -- the act of watching provides nothing to the world. The modern man spends his days in an empty stupor, letting the waves of media endlessly wash over him. Make no mistake, media itself is not the problem. Media can be a wonderful thing, if only we filter the excellent from the mediocre, and treat the it with the reverence it deserves. To be blessed by an incredible piece of media is a wonderful privilege, one that only people of our time get to experience. And yet we take this privilege for granted, naively ignoring the wisdom of our fellow man in search of the next big dopamine hit.

It is from this observation that I have found the *lowest* productive activity, which I call **Conscious Consumption**. Out of the ocean of endless information the conscious consumer picks something interesting, perhaps a book or a blog post. Then he dives deep, *writing down* the key ideas and taking a moment to reflect on how this piece of media affects his worldview. The conscious consumer asks questions like:

- Do I agree with what the author is saying?
- How does this relate to my current knowledge?
- Could this knowledge help me create something?

This state of paying close attention to the media in front of us should become not just the default, but the *only* way in which we consume media. One might object and say that such a process is slow and tedious, but this is the point (see principle 5). By forcing ourselves to think deeply about everything we consume, we can deliberately and carefully build real knowledge.

I mentioned previously that conscious consumption should be viewed as the lowest productive activity. That label isn't meant to be demeaning, as even the most brilliant people need to take the time to learn from others. But as the conscious consumer takes buckets from the ocean of endless information and places them on his boat, he begins to notice patterns. Perhaps the water closer to shore is a different colour, or the water in one part of the ocean contains a certain fish. It is at this point that the conscious consumer creates a theory of his own, and with this act he fulfills his purpose and becomes a *creator*.
