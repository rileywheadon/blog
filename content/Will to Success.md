title: Will to Success

A common argument for believing in free will is that without this belief, life would be meaningless. Someone who doesn't believe in free will would inevitably collapse into an endless spiral of hedonism. I think this is a reasonable position to take, and one that a lot of people would agree with.

However, the same people who hold this belief on free will go around and say things like "how can I be successful when the efficient market hypothesis exists?", or "how can I be successful when XYZ person has XYZ resources that I don't?"

But I think the rational answer to these feelings is "if I don't believe I can be successful, then my life will collapse into an endless spiral of nihilism." This argument doesn't rely on the efficient market hypothesis being false, or you having some resource that XYZ person does not, but instead makes use of the same logical trick as the free will argument.

We have no idea if free will exists, the debate is entirely philosophical. While its *slightly* easier to prove something like the efficient market hypothesis, or quantify one's advantages in life, there's still a lot of room for error. In all likelihood, you'll never know for certain if you're dumber than the people around you, or if you've had it harder than them. But *it doesn't matter*. One has to believe in their success, in order to be successful.
