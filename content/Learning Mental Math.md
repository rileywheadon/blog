Since July 11th I've been practicing my mental math skills with [zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/). I have genuinely no idea why I'm doing this (maybe I'll apply for a quant job in the future?) but its a fun thing to do in my spare time. The first time I tried the two minute test (with default settings), I scored 25. I was pretty embarrassed by this score, so I've since committed to practicing every day. Here's what I've learned.

## Strategy

I started by doing just addition, where I was scoring between 30 and 40 in the first couple of days. While practicing, I focused primarily on accuracy. After a few days, I added subtraction, then multiplication, then division. Division was the worst, I think the first time I tried it I scored 9. I also skimmed through *Secrets of Mental Math* by Benjamin and Shermer. There was some useful advice here, but a lot of it wasn't applicable to zetamac.

I've also been keeping a record of my best scores and various tricks I've learned. The most useful one has to be multiplying by $11$. If $a$, $b$ are digits, then: $ab \times 11 = a[a+b]b$, carrying when necessary.

## Progress

On July 19th (8 days into learning), I managed to score 53, a huge improvement over my initial score of 25. I've only been practicing about half an hour a day, so I'm really pleased with this improvement.
