title: Why I Write
draft: true

In the 21st century, the average person is exposed to an absurd amount of information. The vastness of the internet is such that even if we had an entire lifetime or a hundred to comb through it, we wouldn't even scratch the surface of what there is to see. From this observation, its easy to draw the conclusion that any contribution to this sea of knowledge would be insignificant. I think this belief is not only false, but extremely dangerous. *Your thoughts are important*, and here's why.

## 1: There are many ways to skin a cat.

Perhaps this blog post has no original ideas. When I wrote it, I sat down, opened up some books, and shuffled their ideas around until I created a coherent blog post. Does this mean that this blog post has no utility? *Of course not*. Suppose you want to learn linear algebra. You might start by downloading a textbook on the subject, or decide to watch an educational [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs). Neither the textbook nor the video contain a single *new* idea. Rather, they present something that is already known in an easily digestible way. This type of work is actually *extremely* important for furthering human knowledge.

Over the years, human knowledge has to be compressed for future generations to understand. Today's high school students study concepts in physics that were entirely unknown mere centuries ago. Reaching the forefront of modern mathematics in a subject like algebraic geometry involves catching up on hundreds of years of research from some of the worlds most brilliant minds. The knowledge bubble is constantly growing, and providing high-quality expository content is one way to help individuals accelerate themselves towards its boundary. Passing down the knowledge of the past is becoming increasingly more important, for the more knowledge we have the easier it is for things to slip through the cracks.

## Becoming a Hacker

The last three principles of the list come from [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html), which is an excellent introduction to the thought process of the modern open source movement. I think its important to emphasize that *writing is essential for hacking*, as its the only (efficient) way to share knowledge with others. By building this system and documenting my thoughts, my ideas, and my processes, I am teaching myself how to share knowledge with others as I produce it.
