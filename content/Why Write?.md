title: Why I Write
draft: true
---

In the 21st century, the average person is exposed to an overwhelming amount of information. The vastness of the internet is such that even if we had an entire lifetime or a hundred to comb through it, we wouldn't even scratch the surface of what there is to see. From this, its easy to conclude that any contribution to this sea of knowledge would be insignificant. I think this belief is not only false, but dangerous. *You should write*, and to explain why I'm going to respond to three common objections to this statement.

## 1: What if I have no new ideas?

Perhaps this blog post has no new ideas. Does this mean it has no utility? *Of course not*. Suppose you want to learn linear algebra. You might start by downloading a textbook on the subject, or decide to watch an educational [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs). Neither the textbook nor the video contain a single *new* idea. Rather, they present something that is already known in an easily digestible way. This type of work is actually *extremely* important for furthering human knowledge.

Over the years, human knowledge has to be compressed for future generations to understand. Topics in biology like genetics and ecology were completely unknown 200 years ago. Today's high school physics curriculum covers information about atomic particles that leading scientists discovered at the beginning of the 20th century. If you've ever written a computer program before, you're doing something that was effectively impossible prior to the 1970s. Nearly everybody today knows something that *nobody* knew 100 years ago. This is nothing short of extraordinary.

However, this progression of human knowledge comes with a cost. Today, reaching the forefront of any science involves catching up on an enormous amount of research. The societal knowledge bubble is constantly growing, and providing high-quality expository content is one way to help individuals accelerate themselves towards its boundary. Passing down the knowledge of the past is becoming increasingly more important, lest we [forget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko) things we already know.

Expository writing isn't easy, but that doesn't mean you need to be an expert in order to produce it. By virtue of our unique perspectives, backgrounds, and writing style, each individual frames the topics they are writing about in a different way. Each individual is capable of connecting their ideas in a way that nobody else can, giving rise to original insights no matter how small. Even if many people don't prefer the way you write , there's always going to be a small group who thinks its *just right*. These are the people you're writing for.

## 2: What if nobody reads my writing?

Writing is a skill, and like all skills, it can only be developed through practice. Over the past few weeks of forcing myself to write daily, I've found that its become a lot easier to express my thoughts. I'm not the greatest writer, and most of my first drafts are disorganized, unclear, and generally pretty awful. Converting one of my drafts into something I'm willing to publish is a challenge, but having a collection of low-quality writing to pull ideas from has proven to be really useful. Writing daily also gives me a glimpse into my "history of thought", and can help me identify patterns in my life. All things considered, I've grown to enjoy writing for the sake of it, regardless of whether anybody else reads my work.

## 3: What if I have nothing to write about?

Do you find yourself giving advice to your friends/family?

*Write down your advice.*

Have you had an interesting experience recently? Did you go on vacation or meet someone famous?

*Write about it.*

Have you just finished reading a really good book?

*Write a book review.*

Have you done (academic or non-academic) research?

*Write about what you found.*

Have you created a piece of art or a personal project?

*Write about it.*

Have you made an impactful change to your diet or lifestyle?

*Write about it.*

Have you picked up a new hobby or learned to play an instrument?

*Write about it.*

Have you overcome a major challenge in your life?

*Write about it.*

It seems to me like there's plenty to write about.
