title: Why I Write
draft: true

In the 21st century, the average person is exposed to an absurd amount of information. The vastness of the internet is such that even if we had an entire lifetime or a hundred to comb through it, we wouldn't even scratch the surface of what there is to see. From this observation, its easy to draw the conclusion that any contribution to this sea of knowledge would be insignificant. I think this belief is not only false, but extremely dangerous. *You should write*, and to explain why I'm going to answer five common objections to this statement.

## 1: What if my writing isn't original?

Perhaps this blog post has no original ideas. When I wrote it, I sat down, opened up some books, and shuffled their ideas around until I created a coherent blog post. Does this mean that this blog post has no utility? *Of course not*. Suppose you want to learn linear algebra. You might start by downloading a textbook on the subject, or decide to watch an educational [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs). Neither the textbook nor the video contain a single *new* idea. Rather, they present something that is already known in an easily digestible way. This type of work is actually *extremely* important for furthering human knowledge.

Over the years, human knowledge has to be compressed for future generations to understand. Today's high school students study concepts in physics that were entirely unknown just centuries ago. Reaching the forefront of modern mathematics in a subject like algebraic geometry involves catching up on hundreds of years of research from some of the worlds most brilliant minds. The knowledge bubble is constantly growing, and providing high-quality expository content is one way to help individuals accelerate themselves towards its boundary. Passing down the knowledge of the past is becoming increasingly more important, for the more knowledge we have the easier it is for things to slip through the cracks.

## 2: What if nobody reads my writing?

Writing is a skill, and like all skills, it can only be developed through practice. Over the past few weeks of forcing myself to write daily, I've found that its become a lot easier to express my thoughts. I'm not the greatest writer, and most of my first drafts are disorganized, unclear, and generally pretty awful. Converting one of my drafts into something I'm willing to publish is a challenge, but having a collection of low-quality writing to pull ideas from has proven to be really useful. Writing daily also gives me a glimpse into my "history of thought", and can help me identify patterns in my life. All things considered, I've grown to enjoy writing for the sake of it, regardless of whether anybody else reads my work.

## 3: What if I have nothing to write about?

Do you find yourself giving advice to your friends/family?

*Write down your advice.*

Have you had an interesting experience recently? Did you go on vacation or meet someone famous?

*Write about it.*

Have you just finished reading a really good book?

*Write a book review.*

Have you done (academic or non-academic) research?

*Write about what you found.*

Have you created a piece of art or a personal project?

*Write about it.*

Have you made an impactful change to your diet or lifestyle?

*Write about it.*

Have you picked up a new hobby or learned to play an instrument?

*Write about it.*

Have you overcome a major challenge in your life?

*Write about it.*

I'm almost certain that everyone reading answered yes to at least one of the questions above. It seems to me like there's plenty of things to write about.
