A common theme of amongst my beliefs is that society is in decline. But what does this mean? In [Preventing the Collapse of Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko), Jonathan Blow posits that technological progress should *not* be taken for granted. To justify his claim, he cites points of technological collapse throughout history, such as the Late Bronze Age [Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse), the Fall of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire), or more recently the decline of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) after the Apollo program. Once Blow establishes the idea that technological decline *is possible*, he finishes the talk by arguing that computer software is currently in decline.

The idea that technology can decline runs contrary to our modern accelerationist philosophy, which operates on the delusion that new is always better. While I've never fully bought in to accelerationism, I still believe the philosophy has had a profound effect on my worldview. I think much of the 21st century populous holds the view that our most brilliant minds, our *scientists*, are doing *very hard stuff* all the time to make the world a better place. This belief, while sometimes true, can introduce the notion that *scientists are always making progress*. Jonathan Blow explains is that the latter idea is not only false, but utterly ridiculous. In fact, scientists are sometimes so hopeless that they are *actually losing knowledge*.

I feel that the belief that scientists are *very smart people* doing *very hard stuff* makes the science, especially the more technical subjects like physics and mathematics, feel *extremely* intimidating. In [The Parable of the Talents](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/) Scott Alexander argues that our roles in society are essentially genetically determined, and that we should accept that [we can't all be physicists](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/07/annals-of-psychometry-iqs-of-eminent.html). While most people aren't capable of becoming the next Linus Torvalds or Ramanujan, many of us *are* capable of contributing to humanity's understanding of computer science or mathematics. In fact, if the field of science you are contributing to is in decline, simply *writing stuff down* or *teaching someone what you know* could potentially contribute to humanity's knowledge!

So perhaps the decline gets too sour of a reputation. Despite all the financial and societal challenges of the decline, there's something beautiful about knowing that *you* could be bastion of knowledge for humanity.
