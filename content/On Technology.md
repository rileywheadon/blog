*What is technology and is it good?*

In this essay, I will attempt to answer this question. First of all, we need to define precisely what technology is.

The economists define technology as a force multiplier that allows us to produce more output with the same amount of labour and capital. This is an *extremely* general definition that encompasses many things we wouldn't normally consider to be technology. For example, an efficient new arrangement for a factory floor could be considered technology, since it allows for more output with the same amount of labour (workers) and capital (raw materials). Under this definition, technology is undeniably a good thing. Its *literally* alchemy--who wouldn't want to make twice as many widgets from the same block of wood?

So we're done, right? Technology is good, and we can run off into the sunset happily ever after. Not quite.

Lets imagine I invented a machine that turns sand into oil. This machine is *really* efficient. Using it, I can make produce oil for $5 a barrel. Its also great for the environment. There's no harmful byproducts, its energy efficient, and it doesn't require [destroying hundreds of acres of land](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/aug/03/canadas-tar-sands-landscape-from-the-air-in-pictures). I release my machine to the world to much praise. "We can shut down the tar sands! This will solve climate change!" The price of oil plummets overnight. The price of gas falls to 50 cents per litre. Everybody starts driving more. People spend more time in traffic. Airplane tickets get cheaper. People start flying more. Electric car sales fall. The government paves hundreds of thousands of kilometres of new roads. A year after my machine was invented, the amount of CO2 emissions actually *increased*.

The situation I just described was an example of [Jevon's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox), named after the English economist William Stanley Jevons. He discovered that when more efficient steam engines were built, the demand for coal increased dramatically.

## Original

A common theme of amongst my beliefs is that society is in decline. But what does this mean? In [Preventing the Collapse of Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko), Jonathan Blow posits that technological progress should *not* be taken for granted. To justify his claim, he cites points of technological collapse throughout history, such as the Late Bronze Age [Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse), the Fall of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire), or more recently the decline of [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) after the Apollo program. Once Blow establishes the idea that technological decline *is possible*, he finishes the talk by arguing that computer software is currently in decline.

The idea that technology can decline runs contrary to our modern accelerationist philosophy, which operates on the delusion that new is always better. While I've never fully bought in to accelerationism, I still believe the philosophy has had a profound effect on my worldview. I think much of the 21st century populous holds the view that our most brilliant minds, our *scientists*, are doing *very hard stuff* all the time to make the world a better place. This belief, while sometimes true, can introduce the notion that *scientists are always making progress*. Jonathan Blow explains is that the latter idea is not only false, but utterly ridiculous. In fact, scientists are sometimes so hopeless that they are *actually losing knowledge*.

I feel that the belief that scientists are *very smart people* doing *very hard stuff* makes the science, especially the more technical subjects like physics and mathematics, feel *extremely* intimidating. In [The Parable of the Talents](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/) Scott Alexander argues that our roles in society are essentially genetically determined, and that we should accept that [we can't all be physicists](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2008/07/annals-of-psychometry-iqs-of-eminent.html). While most people aren't capable of becoming the next Linus Torvalds or Ramanujan, many of us *are* capable of contributing to humanity's understanding of computer science or mathematics. In fact, if the field of science you are contributing to is in decline, simply *writing stuff down* or *teaching someone what you know* could potentially contribute to humanity's knowledge!

So perhaps the decline gets too sour of a reputation. Despite all the financial and societal challenges of the decline, there's something beautiful about knowing that *you* could be bastion of knowledge for humanity.
