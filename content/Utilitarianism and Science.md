>***Utilitarianism** (Noun)*: The doctrine that an action is right insofar as it promotes happiness, and that the greatest happiness of the greatest number should be the guiding principle of conduct.

Proponents of capitalism *claim* that capitalism is an effective economic system because it is utilitarian, and utilitarianism is good. This argument begins by postulating that capital is a proxy for utility. Under capitalism, people to acquire capital, which they then spend to maximize their personal utility. Corporations provide goods and services to the society, on the condition that they produce more utility than they consume (i.e. they make a profit). The reason why capitalism is better than socialism (which people also argue for on the basis of utilitarianism) is that the individual is better at maximizing their personal utility than the state. This is probably true.

Its hard to argue *against* utilitarianism, because to do so would mean that you think lots of happiness for lots of people is bad. Therefore, detractors of utilitarianism are at best elitist and at worst anti-human. But is this true?

Lets think about science. I think that science is good for society, and there's a good chance you do too. But *why* do we think science is good for society? Usually, when people talk about the benefits of science, they talk about consumer goods made possible by science like computers, smartphones, and televisions. A particularly well-read defender of science might cite older inventions, like the sewing machine or steam engine as examples of ways science has improved our life. What these arguments are really saying is that *science is good because it is utilitarian*. We believe that doing science is an act that promotes the greatest happiness in the greatest number of people.

In many ways it feels that science is no longer utilitarian. I don't feel that science has brought me any significant improvements in quality of life within my lifetime. With the exception of the internet, one could say that science hasn't improved society in my parent's lifetime. And I think more and more people are realizing this. What good is a slightly faster iPhone or an 8k television or an electric car in this economy, with rampant increases in the cost of living? From a utilitarian perspective, this is a completely reasonable argument. We should spend less money on cutting edge research in the sciences, which may or may not be useful, and use it to feed the poor, provide healthcare, and combat climate change.

But something just about this argument doesn't seem right. The act of modelling and understanding nature is something humans have been doing forever. Its something unique to our species. Its what makes us human. In many ways, science is a form of high culture, a demonstration of surplus from a society that has everything to lose, but is fearless in pursuing the truth.
