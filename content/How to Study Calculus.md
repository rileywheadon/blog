title: How to Study Calculus
draft: false
---

As of July 2024, I've been a TA for four first-year calculus courses at UBC. While working with students, I often get asked "how do I succeed in this class?" or more often, "how do I pass this class?" Here's my advice.

## 1: Make a Spreadsheet

Keep a list of questions you struggled with and write down what you learned from them. I use a spreadsheet that looks like this:

| Question | Concept | Notes |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| WW00, Q1   | FTC | Use the chain rule to differentiate. |
| ... | ... | ... |

I also like to colour code the questions: green if I understand everything, yellow if I'm a little confused, or red if I'm completely lost. I don't include every practice question I do, just the ones I get wrong. This technique can be a life saver in exam season, because it provides you with a personalized list of challenging questions to study from. Additionally, reading through the "Notes" column before an exam is an easy way to recall the techniques you've learned throughout the course.

## 2: Don't Forget the Easy Stuff

With the fast pace of math courses, its easy to assume that you don't have time to review previous material. But I think this is a terrible mindset. Calculus exams are unforgiving, and you *will* do poorly if you don't have a solid understanding of precalculus. I highly encourage everyone who thinks they might have gaps in their foundational knowledge to review the following topics:

- Exponent laws
- Logarithm rules
- Finding intercepts and asymptotes
- Function composition and inverse functions
- Trigonometric functions and the unit circle

It shouldn't take you more than a couple hours to go over these concepts, and it will make the rest of your semester *so* much easier if you do.

## 3: Put the Calculator Away

If you graduated from the Canadian high school system, you were probably allowed a calculator for your precalculus classes. However, calculators are not allowed in the first-year calculus courses at UBC (and most upper-year math courses as well). I've known a few students who lived in denial of this policy and continued using a calculator whenever possible throughout the semester. Unsurprisingly, these people would later lose marks on exams due to computation errors. To minimize the chances of these silly mistakes, I think its best to avoid using a calculator while doing practice problems. Mental math isn't fun, but it is necessary for success in calculus. One exception to this rule is the written assignments in MATH 100/101, which often require more laborious calculations. You should still try to solve these problems with pencil and paper, but *definitely* check your answers with a calculator.

## 4: Let Yourself Struggle

If you *don't* have an exam soon, its okay to struggle with practice questions. Oftentimes, you learn a lot more this way than you would by asking a friend or going to office hours. This is because trying new ideas and getting things wrong gives you a deeper understanding of the material. When you finally get the right answer, you'll understand not just *how* to get the solution, but *why* the solution works. Trust me -- spending an hour thinking your way through one really hard problem can be more productive than doing ten easier problems in the same period of time. Obviously, apply this advice reasonably. If you've exhausted every idea you have, its probably time to get help.

## 5: Practice Being Fast

If you *do* have an exam soon, you should practice doing problems quickly. I've found that math exams have more restrictive time limits than exams in other departments, especially on midterms. The all-too-common experience of "I remembered how to solve the problem after the test!" is ultimately a problem of being too slow. Find out how long the test is, find out how many questions there are, and make sure you can work fast enough.

When it comes to actually writing tests, I would recommend tackling the easiest problems first. If you're well prepared, you should get through these problems relatively quickly, leaving you with plenty of time to think about the harder problems. On final exams, I like to go to the bathroom at the halfway point -- I find this helps me refocus. When it comes time to check your work, try doing the problems *in reverse*. For instance, if a question asks you to evaluate an integral, you should check that the derivative of your answer is the original function. It isn't always this straightforward, but try to have a mindset of *verifying* and not *doing over*.

## Conclusion

The first-year calculus courses at UBC are challenging for everyone, even math majors. I know someone who has taken over fifteen math courses at UBC and still says the MATH 101 final was the hardest exam they've ever written. Luckily, there are tons of resources available for students. Sign up for piazza, go to office hours, and discuss the material with your friends. Success in these classes is not impossible -- thousands of students score above 80% in MATH 1XX every year. I believe that you can be one of them. Good luck!
